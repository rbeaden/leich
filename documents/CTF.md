([ctf-katana](https://github.com/JohnHammond/ctf-katana)). - "This repository, at the time of writing, will just host a listing of tools and commands that may help with CTF challenges. I hope to keep it as a "live document," and ideally it will not die out like the old "tools" page I had made" -John Hammond
